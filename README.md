  ## Description 
  
  I created a content management system or command line application to manage an employee database.

  I created this using JavaScrip and MySql.

  I also had to use console.table, inquirer, dotenv and mysql2.

  I created one main function with an inquirer prompt that redirects to several other functions based on user input. 

  The user is able to view all employees in the database, add an employee, update an employee's role, view all roles in the database, add a role, view all departments and add a department.

  All of these functions use an inquirer prompt to get user input and adjust the database accordingly.

  After each addition, the user will see the updated database in the terminal.

  The user can also manually select to view each table in the database without first having to adjust something.
